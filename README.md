# Web Dev 2 - Mid Term Project

## Instructions

1. Create a website that displays weather data from a Weather API. Create an account on [https://www.weatherapi.com/]
2. Your website should have the required features (see Features below). You have a lot of data to play around with so the more features, the better!
3. Create your own design in Figma
4. The website should be responsive/mobile-friendly

## Features

- Using an input field, display the weather data of a specific city
- Display both celsius and fahrenheit
- Display the forecast for the next 7 days
